## Configuration

Please create and .env file first in the root directory of the folder, and make sure to mention the following variables

```
REACT_APP_URL= http://localhost:8000

```

For Demo, I have already added an env file with the name sample.env, to make it easy to configure simply rename sample.env to .env file

To start the frontend run the command 

```

npm install && npm start

```

If you have yarn installed then

```

yarn install && yarn start

```

Paste first the ENV file
